## problem

Researchers across the US use cyberinfrastructuress to conduct research. However, the value that
these infrastructures provide makes them compelling targets for attackers, who may wish to
exfiltrate research data, ransom the infrastructure via encryption, or enlist resources into botnets
to send spam, participate in DDOS, or perform cryptomining.

## overview

The DISCERN project at the [USC Information Sciences Institute](https://isi.edu) is producing
datasets to capture the behavior of malicious activity on research cyberinfrastructure resources.
Our work focuses on [SPHERE testbed](https://sphere-project.net), a novel research infrastructure
which provides resources and services in support of security and privacy research. Our approach is
to conduct malicious activities on the infrastructure in a controlled fashion, alongside legitimate
activities from SPHERE users, and to produce datasets that capture those malicious and benign
activities. Our goal is that these datasets provide visibility into how malicious activities play
out on cyberinfrastructures, thereby enabling research into cyber defenses that can better secure
the nation's cyberinfrastructure resources.
