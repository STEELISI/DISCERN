We can do what-if scenarios with regard to different threats. SoC in a box, AI toolkit that will do automated security analysis.

# Account management

* Zero trust
* Who has root access to what
  
# Network topology

* Do you use private IPs?
* Are there any public IPs? Which ones?
* What services are running on public IPs? Can we scan them to get a clearer view?
* What is your entire IP range for the facility? Can we scan it to get a clearer view?

# Security techonologies

* Do you have a firewall? What type?
* Are all machines behind the firewall?
* What are the firewall rules? (give them commands to run for each technology to get the rules out)

# Containers

* Do your users access a metal machine or containers?
* Which container technologies you use (select all that apply):
 * Docker
 * Kubernetes
 * VMWare
 * Xen
 * Linux containers
* Do any users have access to bare metal machines? Which machines? Which user groups (e.g., ops only or regular users)?
